At this point, your project layout should look like the following:

```text
my-app/
├─ .gitignore
├─ node_modules/
├─ public/
├─ src/
│  └─ ...
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
└─ tslint.json
```

* `tsconfig.json` contains TypeScript-specific options for our project.
* `jest.config.js` makes our test buils.
* `package.json` contains our dependencies, as well as some shortcuts for commands we'd like to run for testing, previewing, and deploying our app.
* `public` contains static assets like the HTML page we're planning to deploy to, or images. You can delete any file in this folder apart from `index.html`.
* `src` contains our TypeScript and CSS code. `index.tsx` is the entry-point for our file, and is mandatory.


- Using Routers 
- Cutomize Dialog and you can pass title, contentDialog, etc to main Dialog -> src/components/customDialog/* 
- Reusable Components e.g. ShowIncreaseAndReduceButtons.tsx, CustomRating

# Balloon Store Front

## Prerequisites
This quick start guide will teach you how to wire up TypeScript with [React]((https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),  [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) and To learn React check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

By the end, you'll have

- a project with React and TypeScript
- testing with [Jest](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes.html)
- UI and styled [mui](https://mui.com/) and 

We assume that you're already using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
You may also want to get a sense of [the basics with React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html).

# More Information about Project

- (/ASSIGNMENT.md)(https://github.com/)

## Install Dependencies

```shell
npm i
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```shell
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


```shell
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Setting up source control

Our testing tool, Jest, expects some form of source control (such as Git or Mercurial) to be present.
For it to run correctly, we'll need to initialize a git repository.

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit."
```
